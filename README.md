Project Description for GitHub Repository: "Number Guessing Game"

# Introduction:
This GitHub repository contains a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be interactive and challenges the player to guess a random number within a specified range.

# Features:
1. Random Number Generation:
   - The game generates a random number between 1 and 20 at the beginning and whenever the player decides to play again.

2. User Interaction:
   - The player can input their guesses in the provided input field.
   - The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

3. Scoring System:
   - The player starts with a score of 20.
   - For each incorrect guess, the score is decremented.
   - The highscore is maintained and updated if the current game's score surpasses the previous highscore.

4. Visual Feedback:
   - The background color of the page changes to green when the player correctly guesses the number.
   - The width of the number block increases to provide visual emphasis when the correct number is guessed.

5. Reset Functionality:
   - The player can reset the game by clicking the "Play Again" button.
   - This resets the score, generates a new random number, and restores the default visual settings.

# How to Play:
1. Enter your guess in the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button to see if your guess is correct.
3. Receive feedback on your guess and continue playing.
4. If you correctly guess the number, celebrate with a "Bale Bale" message and see your highscore update.
5. Click "Play Again" to reset the game and try again.
